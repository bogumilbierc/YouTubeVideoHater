# YouTubeVideoHater
Chrome extension. Lets You define videos You hate (by keywords) and then they will be automatically skipped.

# Intro
Lets imagine that You hate Justin Bieber. You hate is so much, that You cannot stand a video on YouTube that contains his voice.
Up to now, You would need to go to YouTube tab in chrome and change video, however this is no longer the case! This app will do it for You!

# How it works
- User is defining list of keywords.
- Extension is checking if title of YouTube video that is played right now contains any of keywords. If yes, then video is switched to next (as You would press next button in YouTube player).
- List of hated keywords is automatically synced between Your devices (if You are logged in Chrome).
